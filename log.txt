    I implemented a number of functions for evaluating how the set of identified periodicities varies as a function of the percent identity cutoff. These include several visualization strategies and some heuristic clustering toidentify periods that are stable over a range of percent identities. I'm currently implementing the functions to prioritize these stable periods to ensure that repeat extraction consistently identifies the best repeats.

    Two changes. One, I modified the multiple alignment step to handle large fastqs, by splitting them, performing a MSA on each smaller file, and then using profile-profile alignments to combine them. Two, I changed the way in which periodicities are identified by running through the repeat extraction step withou extacting rpeats. Going to replace this with a more robust heuristic.

    I fixed the bug in TandemFinder where it identified the incorrect repeat. This produced a new bug where it could become trapped in an endless loop. To resolve this I made two fixes: 1) I ensured that all repeats in the array were extracted and masked (that was  bug I missed) and 2) I terminate the repeat search in GetRepeatsInInterval if the set of candidate repeats fails to decrease in size after an iteration. I also modifed the plotting function to plot each tandem identified.

    Added the multiple sequence alignment back into the pipeline and modified the funciton to skip empty fasta files. Complete pipeline ran of the Dmel reference. Need to modify the script to retain the exact boundaries of the array each consensus is dervie from.

    I added several features. First, I modifed the ExtractRepeatsFromArray function to identify all periodicities of the query repeat and greedily extract repeats of these periodicities. I also modified it to only mask identified tandems. This allows the algorithm to identify HORs it would otherwise have missed. I also implemented ClusterMSA, a function which greedily clusters sequences in a multiple sequence alignment into groups, in case a single consensus sequecne is a poor description of the MSA.

    Added a class for storing reference repeat information. Completed the functions needed for building consensus sequences. Need to add functionality to detect when a single consensus sequence is insufficient. Stitched together tandem finding pipeline. Haven't tested yet.

    I added functions to extract tandem repeats from an array ExtractRepeatFromArray. This masks all sequences with >T identity to the expected repeats, but only extracts repeats that are in tandem. Further, I began adding functionality to interact with the MUSCLE multiple alignment program for the purpose of generating consensus sequences.

    I modified FindPeriodicity to only identify the periodicity of tandem repeats in the examined windows. The location of repeats is determined by lagged identity. The adjacent windows containing the same repeat length are join, and these intervals are merged across all examined scales. Further, I modified the LaggedUngappedAlignment function to handle very long sequences.

    I am beginning to restructure FindPeriodicity such that it only identifies periodicities within windows. Subsequent functions will identify contiguous intervals that have specific periodicities and extract the repeats.

    I modified the ParseSeqName function so that is functions properly--previously it converted field values to float, but this breaks the function if field values are strings, such as chromosome names. I them modified ClusterFasta in ReferenceRepeatAnalyzer and ClusterFastaByLengths in FindHomology to use this parser.

    Fixed a bug in FindHomology.FilterLowComplexitySequencesFromFasta. As written, it didn't write any of the repeats in the ignored communities to output, whereas it was intended to ignore those communities when filtering, such that all repeats in those communites would be included in output.

     On branch master
     Changes to be committed:
    Changed the model used to summarize sequence complexity to a multinomial
    distribution assuming all kmers to be equally likely. This is reported
    as log probability divided by numbers of kmers
    
    Added a function to split *.fasta files by sequence complexity.

    Add functions for computing the entropy of a tandem repeat's kmer composition by a binomial approximation. This isn't working well; going to try out modelling it as an occupancy problem.
